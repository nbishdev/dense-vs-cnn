# Dense VS Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook which measures the effect of different types of Neural Networks on image classification.

More specifically, it performs a comparison between using a Fully-connected neural network and a Convolutional neural network for multi-class image classification.

Two sets of experiments are conducted:
* One with the use of the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) database.
* One with the use of the [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) dataset.

In every experiment, for every neural network type, the following metrics are measured:
* Training time
* Accuracy
* Loss
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
